# redirector
Redirector is a (very very) short PHP script the select a link randomly and redirect to it
List your links in links.json keeping the same data structure :
```
{
    "links":[{
        "name":"Google",
        "URL": "https://google.com"
    },
    {
        "name":"Bing",
        "URL": "https://bing.com"
    }
    ]
}
```

Then you only need to call the php file and ... you are done !
